With real-time personalization, our engine ensures that each step of the user journey is personalized, eliminating generic product recommendations and irrelevant content.The personalization process comprises three key stages: Discovery, Engagement, and Nurture. In the Discovery phase, the focus is on refining social media ad campaigns to effectively target the ideal users. Moving into the Engagement phase, the goal shifts to crafting a seamless shopping journey, leveraging an AI assistant to guide users from arrival to checkout seamlessly. Finally, in the Nurture phase, ongoing personalized promotions are offered to cultivate lasting customer loyalty. To facilitate this process, our solutions provide easy integration into any web or mobile application using SDKs or REST APIs. With built-in cold start support, our solutions ensure quality responses even with limited user behavior data. From creating a project to training, publishing, and enjoying the benefits, our platform streamlines the personalization journey.
